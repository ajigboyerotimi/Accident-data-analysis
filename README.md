This project examines a database of road traffic accidents in Great Britain in the year 2020 and investigates the relationships between specific factors and accident occurrence as well as accident severity. The insight gained from this analysis is subsequently utilized to provide recommendations to government agencies on enhancing road safety. Additionally, the findings are used to develop a model for predicting fatalities.

Included in this repository is the jupyter notebook showing all data cleaning and analysis done. Pdfs of the final report and some supporting documents are also included.
